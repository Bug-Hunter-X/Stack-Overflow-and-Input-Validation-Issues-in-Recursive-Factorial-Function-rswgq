function foo(x: int): int {
  if (x == 0) {
    return 1;

    return x * foo(x - 1);
  }

function main(): void {
  echo foo(5);
}
This code is supposed to calculate the factorial of a number. However, it will cause a stack overflow error if the input number is large. This is because the function recursively calls itself until the stack is full.

Another issue is the lack of input validation. The function does not handle negative input or non-integer input.  This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
